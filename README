Teanalyzer (typing effort analyzer) analyzes single words and returns a number indicating how much effort it takes
to type a word on a keyboard.

Teanalyzer is a ruby implementation of the typing effort model described by Martin Krzywinski.
(see http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?typing_effort for details)

Usage:
# for normalized effort of a text
Teanalyzer.calculate('Hello World')             #=> 7.8

# for effort of a word (not normalized)
Teanalyzer.calculate_total('imaginative')      #=> 76.0

# for configuration
Parameters.configure do |p|
    p.base_effort_weight = 0.5
    p.penalty_effort_weight = 0.4
    p.stroke_path_effort_weight = 0.3
end
