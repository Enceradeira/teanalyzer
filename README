Teanalyzer (typing effort analyzer) analyzes single words and returns a number indicating how much effort it takes
to type that word on a keyboard.

Teanalyzer is a ruby implementation of the typing effort model described by Martin Krzywinski.
(see http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?typing_effort for details)

Usage:
Teanalyzer.calculate('hello')            #=> 5.83333333333333
